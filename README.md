<SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

Read more in the [documentation on ReadTheDocs](https://<RTD_NAME>.readthedocs.io/). [View the change log](https://<RTD_NAME>.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releases.html).

## Quickstart

```sh
pip install <PYPI_NAME>
```

## Developer Setup

If you would like to hack on <REPO_NAME>, please check out the
[Ethereum Development Tactical Manual](https://github.com/pipermerriam/ethereum-dev-tactical-manual)
for information on how we do:

- Testing
- Pull Requests
- Code Style
- Documentation

### Development Environment Setup

You can set up your dev environment with:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ethereum/<REPO_NAME>.git
cd <REPO_NAME>
virtualenv -p python3 venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[dev]
```

### Testing Setup

During development, you might like to have tests run on every file save.

Show flake8 errors on file change:

```sh
# Test flake8
when-changed -v -s -r -1 <MODULE_NAME>/ tests/ -c "clear; flake8 <MODULE_NAME> tests && echo 'flake8 success' || echo 'error'"
```

Run multi-process tests in one command, but without color:

```sh
# in the project root:
pytest --numprocesses=4 --looponfail --maxfail=1
# the same thing, succinctly:
pytest -n 4 -f --maxfail=1
```

Run in one thread, with color and desktop notifications:

```sh
cd venv
ptw --onfail "notify-send -t 5000 'Test failure ⚠⚠⚠⚠⚠' 'python 3 test on <REPO_NAME> failed'" ../tests ../<MODULE_NAME>
```

### Release setup

For Debian-like systems:
```
apt install pandoc
```

To release a new version:

```sh
make release bump=$$VERSION_PART_TO_BUMP$$
```

#### How to bumpversion

The version format for this repo is `{major}.{minor}.{patch}` for stable, and
`{major}.{minor}.{patch}-{stage}.{devnum}` for unstable (`stage` can be alpha or beta).

To issue the next version in line, specify which part to bump,
like `make release bump=minor` or `make release bump=devnum`. This is typically done from the
master branch, except when releasing a beta (in which case the beta is released from master,
and the previous stable branch is released from said branch). To include changes made with each
release, update "docs/releases.rst" with the changes, and apply commit directly to master 
before release.

If you are in a beta version, `make release bump=stage` will switch to a stable.

To issue an unstable version when the current version is stable, specify the
new version explicitly, like `make release bump="--new-version 4.0.0-alpha.1 devnum"`

# Legacy 

**pyWebAssembly.py**: Closely follows "WebAssembly Specification, Release 1.0, Dec 13, 2017". Implements Chapter 5, along with necessary parts of Chapters 2 and 4. The resulting recursive-descent parser takes a .wasm file and builds a syntax tree out of Python tuples, lists, and dicts. This process is reversible back to a .wasm file. Functions from the specification are named `spec_<func>(...)` and their "inverses" are named `spec_<func>_inv(...)`.


**metering.py**: Injects a function call before each sequence of unbranching instructions, along with the sum of the costs of instructions in the sequence. Also injects helper functions such as the metering function which adds to the current cycle count, and traps when we exceed a limit.

Before metering (see `fibonacci.wast` for more).
```
  (func (;0;) (type 0) (param i32) (result i32)
    (local i32 i32 i32)
    i32.const 1
    set_local 1
    block  ;; label = @1
      get_local 0
      i32.const 1
      i32.lt_s
      br_if 0 (;@1;)
      i32.const 1
      set_local 3
      i32.const 0
      set_local 2
      loop  ;; label = @2
        get_local 2
        get_local 3
        i32.add
        set_local 1
        get_local 3
        set_local 2
        get_local 1
        set_local 3
        get_local 0
        i32.const -1
        i32.add
        tee_local 0
        br_if 0 (;@2;)
      end
    end
    get_local 1)
```


After metering (see `fibonacci_metered.wast` for more). Notice injected `i32.cost n` `call 1` where n is sum of costs of following instructions (each instruction currently costs 1).
```
  (func (;0;) (type 0) (param i32) (result i32)
    (local i32 i32 i32)
    i32.const 3
    call 1
    i32.const 1
    set_local 1
    block  ;; label = @1
      i32.const 4
      call 1
      get_local 0
      i32.const 1
      i32.lt_s
      br_if 0 (;@1;)
      i32.const 5
      call 1
      i32.const 1
      set_local 3
      i32.const 0
      set_local 2
      loop  ;; label = @2
        i32.const 13
        call 1
        get_local 2
        get_local 3
        i32.add
        set_local 1
        get_local 3
        set_local 2
        get_local 1
        set_local 3
        get_local 0
        i32.const -1
        i32.add
        tee_local 0
        br_if 0 (;@2;)
      end
    end
    i32.const 1
    call 1
    get_local 1)
```

**index.html**: Demo running fibonacci_metered.wasm, with arbitrary argument and cycles limit, and a trap if the cycles limit is exceeded. Arbitrary precision integers are stored as a string or as a sequence of i32s, and are imported and exported to and from fibonacci_metered.wasm.

**fibonacci...**: Various versions of our demo fibonacci function.


TODO:

 * Floating point canonicalization code injector.
 * Interpretter as described in chapter 4.
 * Support text format as described in chapter 6.
