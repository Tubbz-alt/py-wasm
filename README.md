<SHORT_DESCRIPTION>

Read more in the [documentation on ReadTheDocs](https://<RTD_NAME>.readthedocs.io/). [View the change log](https://<RTD_NAME>.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releases.html).

## Quickstart

```sh
pip install <PYPI_NAME>
```

## Developer Setup

If you would like to hack on <REPO_NAME>, please check out the
[Ethereum Development Tactical Manual](https://github.com/pipermerriam/ethereum-dev-tactical-manual)
for information on how we do:

- Testing
- Pull Requests
- Code Style
- Documentation

### Development Environment Setup

You can set up your dev environment with:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ethereum/<REPO_NAME>.git
cd <REPO_NAME>
virtualenv -p python3 venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[dev]
```

### Testing Setup

During development, you might like to have tests run on every file save.

Show flake8 errors on file change:

```sh
# Test flake8
when-changed -v -s -r -1 <MODULE_NAME>/ tests/ -c "clear; flake8 <MODULE_NAME> tests && echo 'flake8 success' || echo 'error'"
```

Run multi-process tests in one command, but without color:

```sh
# in the project root:
pytest --numprocesses=4 --looponfail --maxfail=1
# the same thing, succinctly:
pytest -n 4 -f --maxfail=1
```

Run in one thread, with color and desktop notifications:

```sh
cd venv
ptw --onfail "notify-send -t 5000 'Test failure ⚠⚠⚠⚠⚠' 'python 3 test on <REPO_NAME> failed'" ../tests ../<MODULE_NAME>
```

### Release setup

For Debian-like systems:
```
apt install pandoc
```

To release a new version:

```sh
make release bump=$$VERSION_PART_TO_BUMP$$
```

#### How to bumpversion

The version format for this repo is `{major}.{minor}.{patch}` for stable, and
`{major}.{minor}.{patch}-{stage}.{devnum}` for unstable (`stage` can be alpha or beta).

To issue the next version in line, specify which part to bump,
like `make release bump=minor` or `make release bump=devnum`. This is typically done from the
master branch, except when releasing a beta (in which case the beta is released from master,
and the previous stable branch is released from said branch). To include changes made with each
release, update "docs/releases.rst" with the changes, and apply commit directly to master 
before release.

If you are in a beta version, `make release bump=stage` will switch to a stable.

To issue an unstable version when the current version is stable, specify the
new version explicitly, like `make release bump="--new-version 4.0.0-alpha.1 devnum"`

# Legacy 

*WARNING: This is an early demo in need of a code review.*
  
**pyWebAssembly.py**: Closely follows "WebAssembly Specification, Release 1.0, Dec 13, 2017". Implements Chapter 5, along with necessary parts of Chapters 2 and 4. The resulting recursive-descent parser takes a .wasm file and builds a syntax tree out of Python tuples, lists, and dicts. This file includes an inverse of a canonical form of each function, allowing mapping a syntax tree back to a .wasm file. Functions from the specification are named `spec_<func>(...)` and their inverses are named `spec_<func>_inv(...)`.


**metering.py**: Injects a function call before each sequence of unbranching instructions. This metering function adds to the current cycle count, and traps when we exceed a limit.

Before metering (see fibonacci.wastfor more):
```
  (func (;0;) (type 0) (param i32) (result i32)
    (local i32 i32 i32)
    i32.const 1
    set_local 1
    block  ;; label = @1
      get_local 0
      i32.const 1
      i32.lt_s
      br_if 0 (;@1;)
      i32.const 1
      set_local 3
      i32.const 0
      set_local 2
      loop  ;; label = @2
        get_local 2
        get_local 3
        i32.add
        set_local 1
        get_local 3
        set_local 2
        get_local 1
        set_local 3
        get_local 0
        i32.const -1
        i32.add
        tee_local 0
        br_if 0 (;@2;)
      end
    end
    get_local 1)
```


After metering (see fibonacci_metered.wast for more):
```
  (func (;0;) (type 0) (param i32) (result i32)
    (local i32 i32 i32)
    i32.const 1
    set_local 1
    block  ;; label = @1
      i32.const 4
      call 1
      get_local 0
      i32.const 1
      i32.lt_s
      br_if 0 (;@1;)
      i32.const 5
      call 1
      i32.const 1
      set_local 3
      i32.const 0
      set_local 2
      loop  ;; label = @2
        i32.const 13
        call 1
        get_local 2
        get_local 3
        i32.add
        set_local 1
        get_local 3
        set_local 2
        get_local 1
        set_local 3
        get_local 0
        i32.const -1
        i32.add
        tee_local 0
        br_if 0 (;@2;)
      end
    end
    get_local 1)
```

**fibonacci...**: Various versions of a fibonacci function.

Notes:

 * Because JavaScript does not support 64-bit integers, we allow passing i64 arguments to WebAssembly as two i32s. Helper code is available in both JavaScript and Web
